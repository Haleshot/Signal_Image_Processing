| Sr. No | Concepts          |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 1.     | Elementary signals |

## Theory

### Elementary Signals

In this project, we will work with the following elementary signals:

1. Sine wave: A sinusoidal signal with a specified frequency and amplitude.
2. Unit step: A signal that is 1 for n ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise.
3. Unit ramp: A signal that is equal to the index n for n ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise.
4. Unit impulse: A signal that is 1 at n = 0 and 0 otherwise.
5. Exponential signal: A signal of the form x(n) = a^n, where a is a constant and n ≥ 0.

### Operations on Signals

We will perform the following operations on discrete time signals:

1. Time shifting: Shifting a signal by k units in time.
2. Time reversal: Reversing the order of the signal.
3. Time scaling: Scaling the time axis of the signal by a factor of k.
4. Scalar multiplication: Multiplying the signal by a constant scalar.
